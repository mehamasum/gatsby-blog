Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Below is a diff:

```diff
public class Hello
{
   public static void Main()
   {
-      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
+      System.Console.WriteLine("Rock all night long!");
   }
}
```

This is `inline`. However below is not:

```jsx{6-7}
function Form() {
  // Declare some state variables directly in component body
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary')
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState('Poppins')

  // We moved some state and effects into a custom Hook
  const width = useWindowWidth()
  // ...
}

function useWindowWidth() {
  // Declare some state and effects in a custom Hook
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth)
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  })
  return width
}
```

Here comes python:

```python
def haha():
    print('What did you think bruh?')
    pass
```

Yeah, I didn't either.
